# Mobile UI Generator

Use this skill when a user asks an agent to generate, design, code, or specify a mobile app screen or flow.

This skill is about **mobile UX/UI generation**. It should produce clear design briefs, pattern-aware UI specs, and implementation-ready prompts for agent handoff.

The skill should not merely name a screen type. It must translate the requested app domain and screen flow into concrete mobile design decisions: layout archetype, navigation model, component inventory, states, interactions, copy, typography, and handoff constraints.

## Reference files

- `references/mobile-pattern-library.md` — public-safe mobile UI pattern library distilled from observed mobile screen structures. Use this file when choosing patterns, required components, state matrices, interactions, copy requirements, and anti-patterns.

The reference library intentionally contains **generalized design knowledge only**. It must not include non-public source material, collection mechanics, provider names, or source-specific identifiers.

## Pattern coverage loop

When a new or under-modeled mobile pattern is discovered:

1. Capture it in a private/local backlog first. Do not publish source-specific identifiers or collection mechanics.
2. Normalize it into a generic pattern ID, e.g. `gift_send_receive`, `analytics_report`, `voice_interaction`, or `device_control`.
3. Add the public-safe checklist to `references/mobile-pattern-library.md` with `user_intent`, `layout`, `required_components`, `states`, `interactions`, `copy_requirements`, `accessibility`, and `anti_patterns`.
4. If it changes the always-needed process, update this `SKILL.md`; otherwise keep the detail in the reference file.
5. Run `python3 scripts/validate_patterns.py` and `python3 scripts/validate_site.py` before publishing.

Completion criterion: every newly added pattern has a concrete state matrix and at least one anti-pattern, and no public file exposes non-public source material.

## Core outputs

Produce one or more of the following depending on the request:

- `mobile-ui-brief.md` — human-readable UX/UI generation brief;
- `mobile-ui-brief.json` — machine-readable UI spec;
- `pattern_system` — screen pattern groups, layout archetype, components, interactions, and states;
- `font_profile` — font family, CSS/download URL, fallback stack, and reason;
- `copy_system` — language-specific UI copy guidelines;
- `implementation_prompt` — prompt for a code, Figma, design-system, or image-generation agent.

Do **not** run image generation unless the user explicitly requests image generation.

## 1. Choose language mode first

Ask or infer the output language. If unclear, use the user's language.

| Mode | Output behavior |
|---|---|
| `en` | English narrative and English UI copy |
| `ko` | Korean narrative and Korean UI copy |

Rules:

- Do not mix English and Korean in the same user-facing output unless the user asks for bilingual output.
- Product names, font names, framework names, and brand names may remain in their original language.
- For Korean UI, prefer natural Korean microcopy over literal translation.

## 2. Identify target domain, flow, and UI patterns

Extract three layers from the request:

1. **Domain** — fintech, commerce, mobility, education, game, messenger, healthcare, travel, content, support, etc.
2. **Screen flow** — onboarding, signup, home, search, list, detail, checkout, booking, chat, settings, cancellation, etc.
3. **UI pattern group** — concrete pattern such as `phone_verification`, `bottom_sheet_map`, `PLP_filter_sort`, `review_write`, `points_rewards`, `empty_state_recovery`, etc.

Examples:

- `한국 핀테크 앱 회원가입 휴대폰 인증 화면` => `fintech`, `signup`, `identity_verification`, `phone_verification`, `terms_agreement`, `fixed_bottom_cta`
- `커머스 상품상세 장바구니 결제 화면` => `commerce`, `product_detail`, `cart`, `checkout`, `coupon_payment`, `legal_notice`, `amount_cta`
- `모빌리티 지도 예약 결제 화면` => `mobility`, `map_location`, `reservation_booking`, `bottom_sheet_route`, `eta_price_card`, `payment_cta`
- `게임 앱 메인 로비와 출석 보상 화면` => `game`, `home`, `game_lobby`, `daily_reward`, `quest_progress`, `ranking`
- `교육 앱 오늘의 학습과 퀴즈 화면` => `education`, `lesson_home`, `progress`, `quiz`, `resume_learning`, `wrong_answer_review`
- `메신저 앱 채팅방과 메시지 입력 화면` => `messenger`, `chat`, `message_bubbles`, `composer`, `attachment_menu`, `safe_area_keyboard`
- `서비스 탈퇴 전 확인 화면` => `account`, `account_cancellation`, `risk_disclosure`, `benefit_loss`, `destructive_cta`

## 3. Mobile UI pattern catalog

## 5. Component inventory checklist

When generating a screen, include only the components that fit the selected pattern.

- Navigation: status bar, top app bar, back button, close button, bottom tabs, segmented tabs.
- Inputs: text field, phone field, search field, amount keypad, checkbox, radio, toggle, picker, slider.
- Selection: chips, category grid, filter sheet, sort menu, option cards, plan cards.
- Commerce: product card, price row, coupon row, payment method, order summary, receipt.
- Social/content: feed card, avatar, reaction buttons, comment entry, share/save, media viewer.
- Map/booking: map marker, route card, ETA, calendar strip, time slot, bottom sheet.
- Feedback: toast, snackbar, inline error, banner alert, skeleton, progress bar, empty state.
- Trust/legal: terms link, privacy helper, risk notice, fee disclosure, cancellation policy.
- CTA: primary, secondary, destructive, disabled, loading, sticky/fixed bottom.

## 6. State matrix requirements

For each important component, specify states. At minimum:

```yaml
states:
  screen: [default, loading, empty, error, success]
  input: [empty, focused, filled, invalid, disabled]
  cta: [enabled, disabled, loading, destructive]
  network: [offline, retrying, timeout]
  permission: [not_requested, granted, denied, ask_later]
```

Examples:

- `phone_verification`: invalid code, timer expired, resend available, too many attempts, auto-submit success.
- `checkout`: coupon unavailable, payment failed, address missing, terms unchecked, order success.
- `map_location`: permission denied, GPS loading, no nearby results, route recalculating.
- `chat`: sending, failed to send, attachment uploading, keyboard open, unread separator.

## 7. Domain-specific design guidance

Adapt the interface to the service category:

- **Fintech/banking**: trust, numeric clarity, low-risk CTA wording, strong confirmation states, security cues, fee/risk disclosure.
- **Commerce/marketplace**: product summary, price hierarchy, coupon/payment rows, review/social proof, legal notice near CTA.
- **Mobility/delivery**: map or route preview, ETA, status timeline, bottom sheet, contextual support action.
- **Healthcare/booking**: provider trust, schedule clarity, cancellation policy, privacy-sensitive copy, confirmation step.
- **Education**: progress, module structure, encouragement, resume CTA, quiz/wrong-answer recovery.
- **Game**: high-energy visual hierarchy, rewards, level/progress, ranking, limited-time cues, strong feedback.
- **Messenger/social**: readable conversation rhythm, composer affordance, media attachments, safe-area spacing.
- **Content/media**: media hero, metadata, engagement actions, next-content path, viewer controls.
- **Travel/reservation**: visual appeal, date/guest summary, price, cancellation confidence, itinerary state.
- **Support/help center**: common issue routing, FAQ chips, bot/agent escalation, response time expectation.

## 8. Typography / font profile

For real mobile UX/UI work, include typography. If a service-specific font is confirmed by the user or public brand/design docs, use it. Otherwise choose a free/public Korean UI font profile.

Starter profiles:

| Profile | Use when | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Pretendard | neutral Korean app UI, fintech, commerce, productivity | https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard |
| SUIT | compact modern UI, onboarding/settings/dashboard | https://github.com/sunn-us/SUIT |
| Noto Sans KR | safe Android/Web fallback | https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+KR |
| IBM Plex Sans KR | tech, AI, analytics, editorial/product UI | https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans+KR |
| Spoqa Han Sans Neo | friendly consumer/local commerce UI | https://github.com/spoqa/spoqa-han-sans |
| Wanted Sans | SaaS, recruiting, productivity, professional services | https://github.com/wanteddev/wanted-sans |

Recommended shape:

```yaml
font_profile:
  family: Pretendard
  css_url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/orioncactus/pretendard/dist/web/static/pretendard.css
  fallback: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Apple SD Gothic Neo", "Noto Sans KR", sans-serif
  confidence: recommended fallback
  reason: Neutral Korean mobile UI with strong numeric readability.
```

Rules:

- Do not invent service-specific font names.
- Use confirmed brand typography only when the user provides it or public brand/design docs confirm it.
- Include iOS, Android, and Web fallback font stacks.
- Include a license-check note for commercial use.

## 9. Mobile UX constraints

Always consider:

- safe-area insets and bottom navigation/CTA zones;
- 44pt+ touch targets;
- keyboard behavior for forms and chat composer;
- fixed CTA behavior and scrollable content boundaries;
- readable Korean line breaks and `word-break: keep-all` behavior when relevant;
- contrast, focus states, disabled/loading/error states;
- empty, success, failure, and permission-denied states;
- haptic/animation notes when useful, with reduced-motion fallback.

## 10. Output format

For a substantial screen request, produce this structure:

```markdown

## Do not

- Do not run image generation unless explicitly requested.
- Do not mix languages unless requested.
- Do not invent real brand fonts or proprietary design facts.
- Do not output generic UI advice without selecting concrete patterns.
- Do not describe generated designs as being based on non-public collection or analysis. Use the generalized pattern library instead.
- Do not skip states; mobile UI quality depends on empty/loading/error/success/permission states.
- Do not present implementation mechanics as user-facing product features.
- Do not upload unpublished screenshots, credentials, or project files that the user has not explicitly approved for sharing.
